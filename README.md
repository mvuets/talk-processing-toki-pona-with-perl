Processing toki pona with Perl
==============================

Author: Maxim Vuets - an enthusiast and rationalizer

Duration: 50 min

toki pona is a constructed language, it strives for making the world
simple. Perl is a programming language, it's known to be good at text
processing (mangling? cruching?). They both are good, TIMTOWTDI, fun,
and intensively rely on context.

In this talk I want to showcase you the delights of toki pona and use
it as an example to demonstrate how Perl can be applied for language
processing (mangling? crunching?). We will take a look at parsing
free-form text with a help of Marpa and writing a rubbish generator
with a help of Markov chains.

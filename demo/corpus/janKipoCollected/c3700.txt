Matthew 5:6




Matthew 5:7



Matthew 5:8



Matthew 5:9



Matthew 5:10




Matthew 5:11-5:12 	"Happy are those who know they are spiritually poor; the Kingdom of heaven belongs to them!

"Happy are those who mourn; God will comfort them!

"Happy are those who are humble; they will receive what God has promised!

"Happy are those whose greatest desire is to do what God requires; God will satisfy them fully!

"Happy are those who are merciful to others; God will be merciful to them!


"Happy are the pure in heart; they will see God!

"Happy are those who work for peace; God will call them his children!

"Happy are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires; the Kingdom of heaven belongs to them!


"Happy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven. This is how the prophets who lived before you were persecuted." 	"jan mute li pilin e ni: 'kon mi li ike.' jan ni li pona. jan ni li jo e ma sewi wawa!

The translation draws from the King James Version, which reads "for they will inherit the earth" instead of "they will receive what God has promised."
Salt and Light
Matthew 5:13 - 5:16
Matthew 5:13







Matthew 5:14





Matthew 5:15





Matthew 5:16 	"You are like salt for the whole human race. But if salt loses its saltiness, there is no way to make it salty again. It has become worthless, so it is thrown out and people trample on it.

"You are like light for the whole world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.


"No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl; instead he puts it on the lampstand, where it gives light for everyone in the house.


"In the same way your light must shine before people, so that they will see the good things you do and praise your Father in heaven." 	"sina sama suwi tawa jan ali. taso suwi li weka tan ijo suwi la sina ken ala suwi sin e ona. ona li ala. jan li weka e ona li pana e noka lon ona.


"sina sama suno tawa ma ali. ma tomo li lon nena sewi la sina ken ala weka e ona tan lukin.

"jan ala li pana e ilo suno lon anpa poki. jan li pana e ona lon palisa pi ilo suno. ona li pana e suno tawa jan ali lon tomo.

"sina wile pana sama e suno sina. jan li lukin e ijo pona sina li toki e pona pi mama sewi sina." 	 
Teaching about the Law
Matthew 5:17 - 5:20
Matthew 5:17 - 5:18













Matthew 5:19









Matthew 5:20 	"Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law of Moses and the teachings of the prophets. I have not come to do away with them, but to make their teachings come true. Remember that as long as heaven and earth last, not the least point nor the smallest detail of the Law will be done away with  -  not until the end of all things.

"So then, whoever disobeys even the least important of the commandments and teaches others to do the same, will be least in the Kingdom of heaven. On the other hand, whoever obeys the Law and teaches others to do the same, will be great in the Kingdom of heaven.

"I tell you, then, that you will be able to enter the Kingdom of heaven only if you are more faithful than the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees in doing what God requires." 	"o pilin ala e ni: mi wile weka e lawa pi jan Mose e sona tan jan toki pi jan Jawe. mi wile ala weka e ona li wile lon e ona. ma ni en ma sewi li lon la lawa sewi ali li awen. ali li pini la lawa sewi li pini kin.



"ken la sina pali ala e ijo lili pi lawa sewi. ken la sina toki e ni tawa jan ante: 'o pali ala e ijo lili pi lawa sewi.' sina toki e ni la sina lili lon ma sewi wawa. taso sina pali e ijo pi lawa sewi li pana e sona pi lawa sewi tawa jan ante la sina suli lon ma sewi wawa.

"mi toki e ni tawa sina: jan sona pi lawa sewi en jan Palisi li pali e ijo pi lawa sewi. taso sina wile tawa ma sewi wawa la sina li wile pali mute e ijo pi lawa sewi." 	




Teaching about Anger
Matthew 5:21 - 5:26
Matthew 5:21





Matthew 5:22








Matthew 5:23 - 5:24











Matthew 5:25 - 5:26 	"You have heard that people were told in the past, ‘Do not commit murder; anyone who does will be brought to trial.’

"But now I tell you: whoever is angry with his brother will be brought to trial, whoever calls his brother ‘You good-for-nothing!’ will be brought before the Council, and whoever calls his brother a worthless fool will be in danger of going to the fire of hell.

"So if you are about to offer your gift to God at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar, go at once and make peace with your brother, and then come back and offer your gift to God.



"If someone brings a lawsuit against you and takes you to court, settle the dispute with him while there is time, before you get to court. Once you are there, he will hand you over to the judge, who will hand you over to the police, and you will be put in jail. There you will stay, I tell you, until you pay the last penny of your fine.
	"sina kute e ni: tenpo pini la jan li toki e ni: 'o moli ala e jan. sina moli e jan la sina tawa kulupu sona lawa.'

"taso mi toki e ni: sina wile utala e jan ante la sina tawa kulupu sona lawa. sina pana e nimi ike tawa jan ante la sina wile tawa kulupu sona lawa li ken tawa ma anpa seli ike.


"o pilin pi tenpo ni: sina lon tomo sewi li wile pana e ijo pona tawa jan sewi Jawe. taso sina sona e ni: sina ike tawa jan ante. o awen e ijo pona sina lon tomo sewi. o tawa jan ante ni. sina pona tawa jan ante la o kama sin tawa tomo sewi. tenpo ni la sina ken pana e ijo pona sina tawa jan sewi Jawe.

"jan li wile kama e sina tawa kulupu sona lawa la sina wile pini e utala toki li wile ala tawa kulupu sona lawa. sina tawa kulupu ni la jan ni li pana e sina tawa jan sona lawa. jan sona lawa li pana e sina tawa jan wawa lawa. jan wawa lawa li pana e sina lon tomo awen ike. tenpo suli la sina awen lon tomo awen ike. sina pana ala e mani ali la sina ken ala tawa tan tomo awen."
	"kulupu sona lawa" is used to mean "court." More literally, it means "wise group in charge."












The toki-pona translation here begins somewhat differently than the English version. Roughly translated back into English, it reads,  "Imagine this situation: You are in the church..."












jan sona lawa = judge
jan wawa lawa = policeman
tomo awen ike = prison
Teaching about Adultery
Matthew 5:27 - 5:30
Matthew 5:27



Matthew 5:28




Matthew 5:29





Matthew 5:30 	"You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’

"But now I tell you: anyone who looks at a woman and wants to possess her is guilty of committing adultery with her in his heart.

"So if your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away! It is much better for you to lose a part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell.

"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is much better for you to lose one of your limbs than for your whole body to go to hell." 	"sina kute e ni: tenpo pini la jan li toki e ni: 'o unpa ike ala.

"taso mi toki e ni tawa sina: sina lukin e meli li wile jo e ona la sina unpa ike kepeken lawa sina.

"oko wan li kama e ike sina la o weka e ona! sina kama jo ala e ijo sijelo. taso sina weka ala e ona la sina tawa ma anpa seli ike. ni li ike mute.

"luka wan li kama e ike sina la o weka e ona! sina kama jo ala e luka. taso sina weka ala e ona la sijelo ali sina li tawa ma anpa seli ike. ni li ike mute." 	 
Teaching about Divorce
Matthew 5:31 - 5:32
Matthew 5:31



Matthew 5:32 	"It was also said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.'


"But now I tell you: if a man divorces his wife, for any cause other than her unfaithfulness, then he is guilty of making her commit adultery if she marries again; and the man who marries her commits adultery also." 	"tenpo pini la jan li toki e ni: 'sina wile weka tan meli sina la sina wile pana e lipu pi wile weka tawa ona.

"taso mi toki e ni tawa sina: meli li unpa ike la mije ona li ken weka pona e meli ni. taso mije li weka e meli ona tan ijo ante la mije ni li kama e unpa ike. meli pini ona li jo e mije sin la meli ni en mije sin ona li unpa ike." 	


lipu pi wile weka = notice of divorce

The toki-pona version is somewhat different than the English version here.  The toki-pona text reads, "If a wife commits adultery, her husband can justifiably get rid of this wife. But if the husband gets rid of his wife due to other things, this husband causes adultery. If his former wife takes a new husband, then that woman and her new husband commit adultery."
Teaching about Vows
Matthew 5:33 - 5:37
Matthew 5:33





Matthew 5:34 - 5:35












Matthew 5:36




Matthew 5:37 	"You have also heard that people were told in the past, 'Do not break your promise, but do what you have vowed to the Lord to do.'


"But now I tell you: do not use any vow when you make a promise. Do not swear by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by earth, for it is the resting place for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.





"Do not even swear by your head, because you cannot make a single hair white or black.

"Just say ‘Yes’ or ‘No’  -  anything else you say comes from the Evil One." 	"sina kute kin e ni: tenpo pini la jan li toki e ni: 'o pini ala e lawa toki wawa sina. sina wile pali e ijo tawa jan sewi Jawe la o pali e ona.

"taso mi toki e ni tawa sina: sina wile pali e ijo tawa jan ante la o kepeken ala e lawa toki wawa. o suli ala e lawa toki wawa sina kepeken toki pi ma sewi pona. ona li pi jan sewi Jawe. o kepeken ala e toki pi ma ni. noka pi jan sewi Jawe li lape lon ma ni. o kepeken ala e toki pi ma tomo Selusalen. ona li pi jan lawa pona.

"o kepeken ala e toki pi lawa sina. sina ken ala ante e kule pi linja sina.


"o toki e nimi 'pona' anu nimi 'ala.' toki ante li kama tan jan ike Setan." 	"lawa toki wawa" is used to mean "promise." More literally, it translates as "powerful spoken commands."







o suli ala e lawa toki wawa sina kepeken toki pi ... = Don't boost the importance of your promises by using speeches about ...
Teaching about Revenge
Matthew 5:38 - 3:42
Matthew 5:38




Matthew 5:39





Matthew 5:40




Matthew 5:41




Matthew 5:42 	"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'


"But now I tell you: do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, let him slap your left cheek too.

"And if someone takes you to court to sue you for your shirt, let him have your coat as well.

"And if one of the occupation troops forces you to carry his pack one kilometre, carry it two kilometres.

"When someone asks you for something, give it to him; when someone wants to borrow something, lend it to him." 	"sina kute e ni: 'weka oko li wile e weka oko sin. weka pi kiwen uta walo li wile e weka pi kiwen uta walo sin.'

"taso mi toki e ni tawa sina: jan li ike tawa sina la o utala ala e ona. jan li utala e luka sina la o pana e luka ante sina.

"jan li kama e sina tawa kulupu lawa sona li wile e len wan la o pana e len tu.

"ken la jan utala pi ma ante li wile e ni: sina jo e poki suli ona lon nasin wan. taso o jo e ona lon nasin tu.

"jan li wile e ijo la o pana e ona." 	"weka oko li wile e weka oko sin" translates as "The removal of an eye demands the removal of another eye."


The toki-pona translation replaces "cheek" with "hand." The underlying message is maintained, and using "luka" is easier than using some complex phrase to express "cheek" in toki-pona.







The toki-pona text has been modified because toki-pona can't express the concept of a kilometer. The text translates back into English as "Maybe a foreign soldier wants you to carry his big pack along a road. But carry it along two roads."
Love for Enemies
Matthew 5:43 - 5:48
Matthew 5:43




Matthew 5:44 - 5:45a







Matthew 5:45b




Matthew 5:46





Matthew 5:47




Matthew 5:48 	"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your friends, hate your enemies.’


"But now I tell you: love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may become the children of your Father in heaven.


"For he makes his sun to shine on bad and good people alike, and gives rain to those who do good and to those who do evil.

"Why should God reward you if you love only the people who love you? Even the tax collectors do that!


"And if you speak only to your friends, have you done anything out of the ordinary? Even the pagans do that!

"You must be perfect  -  just as your Father in heaven is perfect!" 	"sina kute e ni: tenpo pini la jan li toki e ni: 'o olin e jan pona sina. o pilin ike tawa jan ike sina.'

"taso mi toki e ni tawa sina: o olin e jan ike sina. jan li utala ike e sina la o toki e pona pi jan ni tawa jan sewi Jawe. sina olin sama ni la sina jan lili pi mama sina lon ma sewi pona.

"jan sewi Jawe li kama e ni: suno li kama tawa jan ike en jan pona. telo li kama anpa tawa jan pona en jan ike.

"sina olin e jan pona sina taso la jan sewi Jawe li wile pona tawa sina tan seme? jan pi jo mani ike li olin kin e jan pona ona!

"sina toki tawa jan pona taso. taso ni li suli ala suli? jan pi nasin ante li toki kin tawa jan pona ona!

"sina wile pona sama mama sina lon ma sewi pona." 	




"toki e pona pi jan ni tawa jan sewi Jawe" is used to mean "to pray for." Roughly, it translates as "describe the goodness of this person to God."
olin sama ni = to love like that









I found "tax collector" to be difficult to translate into toki-pona. "jan pi jo mani ike" is the best I could come up with.
Teaching about Charity
Matthew 6:1 - 6:4
Matthew 6:1







Matthew 6:2







Matthew 6:3




Matthew 6:4 	"Make certain you do not perform your religious duties in public so that people will see what you do. If you do these things publicly, you will not have any reward from your Father in heaven.

"So when you give something to a needy person, do not make a big show of it, as the hypocrites do in the houses of worship and on the streets. They do it so that people will praise them. I assure you, they have already been paid in full.

"But when you help a needy person, do it in such a way that even your closest friend will not know about it.

"Then it will be a private matter. And your Father, who sees what you do in private, will reward you.
	"o pali ala e ijo sewi lon poka pi kulupu jan. sina pali e ijo sewi lon poka pi kulupu jan la sina ken ala jo e ijo pona tan mama sina lon ma sewi pona.


"sina pana e ijo tawa jan pi mani ala la o wile ala e ni: jan ali li lukin. jan pi nasin ante tu li lon tomo sewi en nasin li wile e ni: jan ali li lukin e pana mani. jan pi nasin ante tu li wile e toki-pona tan jan ali.

"taso sina pana e ijo tawa jan pi mani ala la o kama e ni: jan pona sina li sona ala.

"jan ante li sona ala. taso mama sewi sina li sona li wile pona tawa sina."
	lon poka pi kulupu jan = near groups of people








jan pi nasin ante tu = hypocrite

lukin e pana mani = see the donation of money
wile e toki-pona tan = want to be praised by


Teaching about Prayer
Matthew 6:5 - 6:15
Matthew 6:5








Matthew 6:6






Matthew 6:7







Matthew 6:8



Matthew 6:9







Matthew 6:10





Matthew 6:11


Matthew 6:12




Matthew 6:13






Matthew 5:14




Matthew 5:15 	"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites! They love to stand up and pray in the houses of worship and on the street corners, so that everyone will see them. I assure you, they have already been paid in full.

"But when you pray, go to your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what you do in private, will reward you.


"When you pray, do not use a lot of meaningless words, as the pagans do, who think that their gods will hear them because their prayers are long.


"Do not be like them. Your Father already knows what you need before you ask him.


"This, then, is how you should pray:

"‘Our Father in heaven:

"'May your holy name be honoured;

"'may your Kingdom come;

"'may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

"'Give us today the food we need.

"'Forgive us the wrongs we have done,
as we forgive the wrongs that others have done to us.

"'Do not bring us to hard testing,
but keep us safe from the Evil One.

"'For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever. +amen.'

"If you forgive others the wrongs they have done to you, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.

"But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive the wrongs you have done." 	"sina toki sewi tawa jan Jawe la o toki ala sama jan pi nasin ante tu! ona li toki sewi lon tomo pi nasin sewi en lon nasin. ona li wile e ni: jan ali li lukin. mi toki kin e ni: ona li jo kin e ijo pona.

"'o lawa ala e mi tawa wile ike. o lawa e mi tan ike.

"'tenpo ali la ma en wawa en pona li pi sina. Amen.'

"sina pilin lili e ike pi jan ante la mama sewi sina li pilin lili e ike sina.


"taso sina pilin mute e ike pi jan ante la mama sina li pilin mute e ike sina." 	"toki sewi" is used to mean "pray." "sewi" can be excluded if the meaning is already clear.

jan pi nasin ante tu = hypocrite












The toki-pona text here is somewhat different than the English version. The toki-pona text reads, "When you pray, don't use lots of silly words. People of other faiths use many silly words and think, 'If I use lots of words in my prayer, the gods will hear me.'"




























The toki-pona text here reads, "Don't lead me to evil desires. Lead me from evil." It is based on the King James Version, which reads, "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
Teaching about Fasting
Matthew 6:16 - 6:18
Matthew 6:16







Matthew 6:17 - 6:18 	"And when you fast, do not put on a sad face as the hypocrites do. They neglect their appearance so that everyone will see that they are fasting. I assure you, they have already been paid in full.

"When you go without food, wash your face and comb your hair, so that others cannot know that you are fasting  -  only your Father, who is unseen, will know. And your Father, who sees what you do in private, will reward you." 	"sina moku ala la o jo ala e sinpin pi pilin ike. jan pi nasin ante tu li pali e ni. ona li wile ike lukin. ona li ike lukin la jan ali li lukin e ni: ona li moku ala. mi toki kin e ni: ona li jo kin e ijo pona.

Riches in Heaven
Matthew 6:19 - 6:21
Matthew 6:19






Matthew 6:20





Matthew 6:21 	"Do not store up riches for yourselves here on earth, where moths and rust destroy, and robbers break in and steal.


"Instead, store up riches for yourselves in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and robbers cannot break in and steal.

"For your heart will always be where your riches are." 	"o awen ala e ijo pona sina lon ma ni. pipi en ko loje jaki li pakala e ijo sina lon ma ni. jan ike li kama jo ike e ijo sina lon ma ni.

"o awen e ijo pona sina lon ma sewi pona. pipi en ko loje jaki li ken ala pakala e ijo. jan ante li ken ala kama jo ike e ijo.

"tenpo ali la sina pilin e ma pi ijo pona sina." 	 
The Light of the Body
Matthew 6:22 - 6:23
Matthew 6:22




Matthew 6:23 	"The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are sound, your whole body will be full of light;

"but if your eyes are no good, your body will be in darkness. So if the light in you is darkness, how terribly dark it will be! 	"oko li sama suno tawa sijelo. oko sina li pona la sijelo sina li suno mute.


"taso oko sina li ike la sijelo sina li pimeja. suno sina li pimeja la pimeja ni li pimeja kin." 	 
God and Possessions
Matthew 6:24 - 6:34
Matthew 6:24





Matthew 6:25







Matthew 6:26 - 6:27









Matthew 6:28 - 6:29








Matthew 6:30






Matthew 6:31 - 6:32






Matthew 6:33





Matthew 6:34 	
"No one can be a slave of two masters; he will hate one and love the other; he will be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.


"This is why I tell you not to be worried about the food and drink you need in order to stay alive, or about clothes for your body. After all, isn't life worth more than food? And isn't the body worth more than clothes?

"Look at the birds: they do not sow seeds, gather a harvest and put it in barns; yet your Father in heaven takes care of them! Aren't you worth much more than birds? Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it?



"And why worry about clothes? Look how the wild flowers grow: they do not work or make clothes for themselves. But I tell you that not even King Solomon with all his wealth had clothes as beautiful as one of these flowers.


"It is God who clothes the wild grass  -  grass that is here today and gone tomorrow, burnt up in the oven. Won't he be all the more sure to clothe you? How little faith you have!

"So do not start worrying: ‘Where will my food come from? or my drink? or my clothes?’ (These are the things the pagans are always concerned about.) Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things.

"Instead, be concerned above everything else with the Kingdom of God and with what he requires of you, and he will provide you with all these other things.

"So do not worry about tomorrow; it will have enough worries of its own. There is no need to add to the troubles each day brings.

	Translated back into English, the toki-pona text here begins: "No one can work a lot for two leaders. The worker thinks this: 'One leader is good. The other leader is bad.'"





The toki-pona text reads somewhat differently than the English. Back in English, it reads, "Due to this, don't feel bad due to the need for food or the need for clothing. If you want to be alive, you must eat. But food doesn't make a good life. Your body needs clothes. But clothes don't make a good body."





The next-to-last sentence of the English version becomes three sentences in toki-pona. They read, "Birds are unimportant. You are very important. That's the truth or what?



Here the toki-pona version differs somewhat from the English text. The toki-pona text reads, "[...] King Solomon had much money and many clothes. But if you look at these colorful plants, then you'll think this: The clothes of Solomon were only a little attractive."

Judging Others
Matthew 7:1 - 7:6
Matthew 7:1 - 7:2







Matthew 7:3 - 7:5











Matthew 7:6
	
"Do not judge others, so that God will not judge you, for God will judge you in the same way as you judge others, and he will apply to you the same rules you apply to others.


"Why, then, do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, and pay no attention to the log in your own eye? How dare you say to your brother, ‘Please, let me take that speck out of your eye,’ when you have a log in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will be able to see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.

"Do not give what is holy to dogs  -  they will only turn and attack you. Do not throw your pearls in front of pigs  -  they will only trample them underfoot."
	"o pilin lili e ike pi jan ante. sina pilin lili e ike pi jan ante la jan sewi Jawe li pilin lili e ike sina. sina pana e toki lawa tawa jan ante la jan sewi Jawe li pana e toki lawa sama ni tawa sina.

Ask, Seek, Knock
Matthew 7:7 - 7:12
Matthew 7:7




Matthew 7:8




Matthew 7:9 - 7:10






Matthew 7:11






Matthew 7:12 	"Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

"For everyone who asks will receive, and anyone who seeks will find, and the door will be opened to those who knock.

"Would any of you who are fathers give your son a stone when he asks for bread? Or would you give him a snake when he asks for a fish?

"Bad as you are, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more, then, will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!


"Do for others what you want them to do for you: this is the meaning of the Law of Moses and of the teachings of the prophets. 	"sina toki e wile la sina jo. sina wile lukin la sina lukin kin. sina kalama lon sinpin la lupa li open.

The Narrow Gate
Matthew 7:13 - 7:14
Matthew 7:13




Matthew 7:14 	"Go in through the narrow gate, because the gate to hell is wide and the road that leads to it is easy, and there are many who travel it.

"But the gate to life is narrow and the way that leads to it is hard, and there are few people who find it." 	"o kepeken e lupa lili. nasin pi ma anpa ike li suli. sina ken tawa mute lon ona. jan mute li lon nasin ni.

"taso lupa pi ali pona li lili. sina wile tawa lon nasin ona la ijo mute li wile pini e sina. jan pi mute lili li lukin e ona." 	




"[T]he way that leads to it is hard" has been changed somewhat in the toki-pona version, which roughly translates back into English as, "If you want to travel on its road, many things want to stop you."
A Tree and Its Fruit
Matthew 7:15 - 7:20
Matthew 7:15





Matthew 7:16




Matthew 7:17



Matthew 7:18



Matthew 7:19


Matthew 7:20 	"Be on your guard against false prophets; they come to you looking like sheep on the outside, but on the inside they are really like wild wolves.

"You will know them by what they do. Thorn bushes do not bear grapes, and briars do not bear figs.

"A healthy tree bears good fruit, but a poor tree bears bad fruit.

"A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a poor tree cannot bear good fruit.

"And any tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown in the fire.

"So then, you will know the false prophets by what they do." 	"jan toki sewi ike li lon. ona li lukin sama soweli pona pi utala ala. taso kon ona li sama soweli utala ike.


"sina lukin e pali pi jan toki sewi ike la sina kama sona e ni: ona li toki ala e lon. linja kasi ike li pana ala e kili pona.

"kasi pona li pana e kili pona. kasi ike li pana e kili ike.

"kasi pona li ken ala pana e kili ike. kasi ike li ken ala pana e kili pona.

"jan li anpa e kasi ike li seli e ona.


"sina lukin e pali pi jan toki sewi ike la sina sona e ni: ona li jan toki sewi ike li toki ala e lon." 	 
I Never Knew You
Matthew 7:21 - 7:23
Matthew 7:21





Matthew 7:22







Matthew 7:23 	"Not everyone who calls me ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter the Kingdom of heaven, but only those who do what my Father in heaven wants them to do.

"When Judgement Day comes, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord! In your name we spoke God's message, by your name we drove out many demons and performed many miracles!’

"Then I will say to them, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you wicked people!’" 	"jan mute li toki tawa mi. 'jan lawa sewi o a!' taso sina wile kama tawa ma sewi pona la sina wile pali e wile pi mama sewi mi.

"tenpo suno pi sona lawa wawa li kama la jan mute li toki e ni tawa mi: 'jan lawa sewi o a! mi mute li weka e kon ike mute li pali e ijo pona mute!'


"mi toki e ni tawa ona: 'mi sona ala e sina. jan ike o tawa weka tan mi!'" 	 
The Two House Builders
Matthew 7:24 - 7:27
Matthew 7:24 - 7:25








*Matthew 7:26 - 7:27 	"So then, anyone who hears these words of mine and obeys them is like a *wise man who built his house on rock. The rain poured down, the rivers overflowed, and the wind *blew hard against that house. But it did not fall, because it was built on rock.
*"But anyone who hears these words of mine and does not obey them is like a foolish man who *built his house on sand. The rain poured down, the rivers overflowed, the wind blew hard against *that house, and it fell. And what a terrible fall that was!" 

"sina kute e toki mi li pali e wile mi la sina sama jan sona. jan sona ni li pali e tomo ona lon kiwen. telo mute li kama anpa. telo mute li lon anpa. kon wawa li lon. taso tomo pi jan sona ni li lon kiwen li anpa ala.

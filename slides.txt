050.www.jpg

-   constructed language, like Klingon or Esperanto

060.why.jpg

-   simplify & KISS: modern world & lang. are cluttered with ways to express
    simple things. break advanced concepts down into fundamental and basic
    elements
-   flex the brain: ever tried Tcl or FP? in a way TP makes you think
    different, excercises your brain
-   fun & joy: because learning and new stuff are cool
-   enlightenment: sapir-whorf hypothesis AKA The principle of linguistic
    relativity - lang determines the way of thinking. new world view,
    enlightenment
-   we are going to see these ideas in following slides

300.parsing.jpg

-   so how the heck this is relevant to Perl?
-   since it's succinct - maybe parse/NLP it?
-   ran across a formal grammar, Ben - tried Marpa?
-   parsing - transforming string into data

310.regex.jpg

-   perl is great at text processing
-   regex are cool, but not really for parsing - rather matching

320.bnf.jpg

-   parsing rules - grammar
-   a convenient way to describe grammar - BNF

330.marpa.jpg

-   Marpa - can take BNF as input.
-   Marpa is a parsing algorithm, C library, binding in Perl
-   by Jeffrey Kegler
-   Marpa parses any language whose grammar can be written in BNF. That
    includes recursive grammars, ambiguous grammars, infinitely ambiguous
    grammars and grammars with useless or empty productions. Marpa does both
    left- and right-recursion in linear time -- in fact if a grammar is in
    any class currently in practical use, Marpa will parse it in linear time.
-   powerful, convenient, fast, powerful, flexible
-   handles ambiguous grammars
-   SLIF - scanless interface, highlevel
-   NAIF - named argument interface, discouraged, middle level
-   Thin - low level access to underlying C lib
-   not an expert, don't know Marpa much
-   gentle quick intro into Marpa

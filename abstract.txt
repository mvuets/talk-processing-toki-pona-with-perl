Topic: Processing toki pona with Perl
Duration: 40 min

toki pona is a constructed language, it strives for making the world
simple. Perl is a programming language, it's known to be good at text
processing (mangling? cruching?). They both are good, TIMTOWTDI, fun,
and intensively rely on context.

In this talk I want to take Perl to the next level and demonstrate how
it can be applied for language processing (mangling? crunching?) using
toki pona as an example. We will take a look at parsing free-form text
with a help of Marpa and writting a rubbish generator with the help of
Markov chains.
